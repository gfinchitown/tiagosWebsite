								<h2 class="bio-head">Synopsis</h2>
								<p class="bio-copy">Born April 15, 1992, Tiago Miguel Sousa Ferreira was 20 when he moved from Portugal to the US on a soccer scholarship with Riverland Community College in Austin, MN. In that same year, he began his acting career (unbeknownst to him) with a supporting role in a theatre production of White Christmas. In 2014, he made the decision to move to Los Angeles to fully immerse himself in the acting world.</p>
								
								<h2 class="bio-head">Acting Career</h2>
								<p class="bio-copy">It was during his first semester at Riverland Community College that Ferreira took a leap of faith and tried an acting class – “I needed an Arts credit and I always wanted to try it, but never really had the courage [to act].” Ferreira said.
	Having experienced the new world of acting, Ferreira concentrated on his newfound passion. This led to starring roles in The Philadelphia Story (C.K. Dexter Haven) & Little Women (Professor Bhaer).
	Later that year, following Little Women, Ferreira was invited to work with the Sod House Theater Company that included well-known actors from Guthrie Theater, Ten Thousand Things Theater, Mu Performing Arts, University of Minnesota and Augsburg College. The opportunity allowed him to reinforce his dreams of becoming a professional actor.
	 Shortly after his arrival in Los Angeles, Ferreira landed a role of Osvaldo in the successful and highly reviewed Hollywood Fringe Festival comedy, Telenovela Wives of Pancho Villa.
	Ferreira has appeared on CONAN (TBS), Matador (El Rey Network) and numerous commercial and print ads.
	He continues to perfect his craft while studying with Robin Dale Meyers (Marge Haber Studios) and Sam Christensen (Sam Christensen Studios).</p>
